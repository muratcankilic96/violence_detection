# violence_detection
A violence detector by sound. It was co-developed with my advisor from Yildiz Technical University. It is still under development and will be published some day. The models are ready and ready to use as .h5 files.

Violence detection is made by two sets of data, with training dataset and testing dataset.
Also can be used for any movie clip you want. I used LibSVM for SVM variant.

The dataset is available privately if you mail me: muratk@uef.fi
